## Y12B-pax1
Y12B-pax1 is a passenger/parachute jumper that can connect to the Y12B aircraft via "dual-control" protocol.
More than one passengers can connect to the same aircraft.

Known issue: it uses WalkView and Walker Milestone 4 - Players can not see each other.

To addess this issue, I will make a stand alone walker "aircraft":  Walker-mp
